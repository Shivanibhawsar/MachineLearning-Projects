## Title
Shopping Virtual Assistant




***
## Description
Nowadays, there are many e-Commerce companies
like Amazon, Flipkart, and Walmart which are selling multiple
products. People are habitual to do online shopping because it’s
easier to do. e-Commerce companies display product titles on
the website which is generated algorithmically. These product
titles are different from natural human language. For example –
“Printed Boy’s Round Neck T-Shirt” – this title can be displayed
as a title but can be different when used by humans.
We propose a Virtual AI Assistant which can be used by users
to search for products based on their language. Users can write
product descriptions and our assistant will predict the product
list. Our model will analyze different categories on a dataset and
predict the product for the user.
